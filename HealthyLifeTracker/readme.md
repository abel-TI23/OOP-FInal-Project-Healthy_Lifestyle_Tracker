
# 🏃‍♂️ OOP Final Project: Healthy Lifestyle Tracker

This program was developed to fulfill the final project requirements for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course.

## 🌱 Inspiration

The idea for this program came from my personal experience of living an unhealthy lifestyle, which has often led me to health issues such as typhoid. As a result, I wanted to build a simple yet meaningful tool to help track two essential aspects of a healthy life: **regular exercise** and **balanced nutrition**.

The app allows users to:

* Create and manage **exercise schedules**
* Plan and record **healthy meals**

While it doesn't include every convenience feature, it focuses on the **core essentials** to promote habit-building and conscious health choices.

As a Computer Science student, this project also reflects the importance of working with **Command Line Interfaces (CLI)** — an environment many developers use daily — while encouraging users to be more aware of:

* The types and durations of exercises they do
* The food they consume and its calorie count

This program is a small step towards a healthier lifestyle, while also applying core OOP principles in a practical way.

## 🛠️ Features

* Object-oriented design using **abstract classes**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**
* Simple **CLI interface**
* Data persistence using **JSON** file storage
* Ability to add, view, and save:

  * Workout routines
  * Meal plans

## 🚀 How to Run

Follow these steps to run the program:

1. **Download all files** from this repository (you can download the entire folder).
   If it comes as a `.zip` file, **make sure to extract it first**.

2. Open your **terminal** or **command prompt** and **navigate to the directory** where the folder is located:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/Healthy_Lifestyle_Tracker
   ```

3. Run the program using Python:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. The program will display a menu with 4 options:

   1. Add Exercise Schedule
   2. Add Meal Plan
   3. View All Activities
   4. Save and Exit

5. All activities you enter will be saved automatically to a JSON file for future use.

## 🙌 Final Notes

This is a minimal, CLI-based application made to help **students like me** track their daily healthy habits using programming.

While simple, it's designed to be extendable — with future possibilities including GUI support or integration with fitness APIs.

Thanks for checking it out, and I hope it helps you as much as it's helping me!
